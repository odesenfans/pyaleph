# Installing a PyAleph node

This tutorial is aimed at people wanting to run an Aleph node with
little experience in system administration.

## 0. Hardware requirements

A Linux server with the following requirements:

-   Ability to install Docker and Docker Compose (eg: recent Debian or Ubuntu)
-   Public IP address
-   The following ports open from the internet:
    -   4001/tcp
    -   4001/udp
    -   4024/tcp
    -   4025/tcp
-   Shell with `sudo` access
-   A text editor

## 1. Software requirements

Install Docker.

On a Debian-based system (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ...), you can use
the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

Add your user to the Docker group

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)
```

Logout, and login again to apply the new group membership.

### Optional: Configure a firewall

A firewall can help you protect against unauthorized access on ports
that should not be exposed publicly. This guide section shows how to use
the [UFW](https://launchpad.net/ufw) simple and popular firewall.

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose gnupg2 pass ufw
sudo ufw allow 22,4001,4024,4025/tcp
sudo ufw allow 4001/udp
```

## 2. Configuration

PyAleph requires two configuration items:

-   A configuration file, usually named config.yml
-   A private key to identify the node on the P2P network.

### Configuration file

This section describes how to create and customize the PyAleph
configuration file. First, download the PyAleph configuration template:

::: {.parsed-literal}
wget
"<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/%7Cpyaleph_version%7C/deployment/samples/docker-compose/sample-config.yml>"
:::

Then rename the file to config.yml:

```bash
mv sample-config.yml config.yml
```

### Ethereum API URL

Your Aleph node needs to connect to an Ethereum API. If you do not run
your own Ethereum node, we suggest you can use Infura or a similar
service.

Register on [infura.io](https://infura.io/), then create a new Ethereum
project. In the settings, get the hosted <https://> endpoint URL for
your project.

The endpoint should look like:
`https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<project-id>` for the test
network or `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<project-id>` for
production.

Edit the `config.yml` file to add the endpoint URL in the
field `ethereum > api_url`.

### Sentry DNS

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) can be used to track errors and receive
alerts if an issue occurs on the node.

To enable Sentry, add the corresponding
[DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) in
the configuration.

```yaml
sentry:
    dsn: "https://<SECRET_ID>@<SENTRY_HOST>/<PROJECT_ID>"
```

### Node secret keys

An aleph.im node must have a persistent public-private keypair to
authenticate to the network. These keys can be created using the Docker
image. We strongly advise to back up your keys once generated.

::: {.parsed-literal}
mkdir keys docker run --rm --user root --entrypoint "" -v
$(pwd)/keys:/opt/pyaleph/keys alephim/pyaleph-node: chown aleph:aleph
/opt/pyaleph/keys docker run --rm --entrypoint "" -v
$(pwd)/keys:/opt/pyaleph/keys alephim/pyaleph-node: pyaleph --gen-keys
--key-dir /opt/pyaleph/keys
:::

To check that the generation of the keys succeeded, print your private
key:

```bash
cat keys/node-secret.key
```

## 3. Run the node with Docker Compose

Download the Docker Compose file that defines how to run PyAleph,
MongoDB and IPFS together.

::: {.parsed-literal}
wget
"<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/%7Cpyaleph_version%7C/deployment/samples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml>"
:::

At this stage, you will need your configuration file and your keys.
Check the configuration section to see how you can generate them.

Modify the Docker Compose file you just downloaded to update the paths
to your configuration file and keys directory. Then start running the
node:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 4. Check that everything is working well

### Check the containers

Check that all the containers have started.

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see the following three containers with a State of "Up":

| Name              | Command                        | State | Ports                                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nfuser_ipfs_1     | /sbin/tini -- /usr/local/b ... | Up    | 0.0.0.0:4001->4001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4001->4001/udp, 5001/tcp, 8080/tcp, 8081/tcp |
| nfuser_postgres_1 | docker-entrypoint.sh ...       | Up    | 0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp                                                       |
| nfuser_pyaleph_1  | pyaleph --config /opt/pyal ... | Up    | 0.0.0.0:4024->4024/tcp, 0.0.0.0:4025->4025/tcp, 127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp     |

### Check the metrics

Check that messages are being processed by the node by looking on the
metric endpoint, by default <http://localhost:4024/metrics> .

The number of messages should change when you refresh the page, starting
with the variable pyaleph_status_sync_pending_messages_total

This endpoint can be ingested by a monitoring solution such as
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to watch the dynamic of the node
starting.

### Check the logs

Make sure that no error is displayed in the logs.

You can use [docker-compose logs] and [docker
logs] for this purpose.

### Check IPFS

IPFS Web UI: <http://localhost:5001/webui>
