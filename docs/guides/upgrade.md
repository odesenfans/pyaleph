# Upgrading a PyAleph node

This tutorial explains how to upgrade your PyAleph node to a newer
version.

## Update the configuration and keys

Version 0.2.0 requires a new way to store the private key on disk. We
provide an automated tool to keep your configuration file and keys up to
date. You must stop the node before running the configuration updater.

### Create the keys directory

The updater expects that you already created a keys/ directory to hold
your private and public keys. If you do not already have one, you need
to create the directory, copy the key of your node in it and adjust the
ownership of the folder:

::: {.parsed-literal}
mkdir keys cp node-secret.key keys/ docker run --rm --user root
--entrypoint "" -v $(pwd)/keys:/opt/pyaleph/keys
alephim/pyaleph-node: chown -R aleph:aleph /opt/pyaleph/keys
:::

### Download the latest image

Upgrade the docker-compose file:

```bash
PYALEPH_VERSION="v0.5.0-rc1"
mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose-old.yml wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/${PYALEPH_VERSION}/deployment/samples/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml"
docker-compose [-f <docker-compose-file>] pull
```

Copy your customizations to the new docker-compose if relevant:

```bash
diff --color --side-by-side docker-compose-old.yml docker-compose.yml
```

### Upgrade your node

```bash
docker-compose [-f <docker-compose-file>] down

docker-compose [-f <docker-compose-file>] \
        run \
        --entrypoint /opt/pyaleph/migrations/config_updater.py \
        pyaleph \
        --key-dir /opt/pyaleph/keys \
        --key-file /opt/pyaleph/keys/node-secret.key \
        --config /opt/pyaleph/config.yml \
        upgrade

docker-compose [-f <docker-compose-file>] down
```

Check that your node's secret key has been migrated

```bash
ls ./keys
```

This should output:

> node-pub.key node-secret.key serialized-node-secret.key

Finally, restart your node:

```bash
docker-compose [-f <docker-compose-file>] up -d
```
